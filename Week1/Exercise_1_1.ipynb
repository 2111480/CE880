    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Oeverall, Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for:\n",
    "* web development (server-side),\n",
    "* software development,\n",
    "* mathematics,\n",
    "* system scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can Python do?\n",
    "* Python can be used for web development application.\n",
    "* Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.\n",
    "* Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.\n",
    "* Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
    "* Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
    "* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n"

We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 3. Make and commit changes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the README.md file.\n",
    "2. Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.\n",
    "3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.\n",
    "4. Write a commit message that describes your changes.\n",
